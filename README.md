## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Set up an API Key**:
   - Sign up at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get your API key.
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the JavaScript file with your actual API key:

     ```javascript
     const response = await fetch(
       `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${location}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=imperial`
     );
     ```

2. (Optional) If using autocomplete, set up the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) and add its key similarly.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. Users can input a city name in the form field.
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeather API and fetches the current weather conditions.
3. The weather data is processed and displayed on the screen, including:
   - Location
   - Temperature (current and feels-like)
   - Weather condition
   - Wind speed
   - Humidity
4. Handles errors gracefully if the city name is invalid or there are network issues.
